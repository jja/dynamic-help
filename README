dynamic-help : DynamicHelpGrailsPlugin

A Grails plugin adding dynamic help tips via a mini-cms.
Based upon:

http://grails.org/plugin/dynamic-help

Updated for Grails 1.3.7, JQuery 1.7, JQuery-UI 1.8.15,
and unnecessary dependencies, plugins, and files removed.


INSTALL

download the latest grails-dynamic-help-VERSION.zip from this repo

in your app, run:

    grails install-plugin grails-dynamic-help-VERSION.zip


NOTES

Note that the jquery-ui plugin is broken and ignores themeDir and can't find your theme
in the documented place, always looking inside the plugin. The default theme has a transparent
background that doesn't work well with the pop-up tip boxes. So either let dynamic-help
include jquery-ui or manage your own styles-- don't rely on jquery-ui's css.
